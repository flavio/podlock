:navtitle: Uninstall Guide

This guide walks you through completely removing PodLock from your Kubernetes cluster.

== Uninstall the Helm chart

Remove the PodLock Helm release:

[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall --namespace podlock podlock
----

== Remove Custom Resource Definitions

WARNING: Deleting the CRDs will also delete all LandlockProfile resources in your cluster.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete crd landlockprofiles.podlock.kubewarden.io
----

== Delete the namespace

Remove the PodLock namespace:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete ns podlock
----

== Clean up node-level resources (optional)

The PodLock NRI plugin stores helper binaries on each node in `/opt/podlock`.
If you want to completely remove all traces of PodLock, run the following command
on each node:

[source,bash]
----
sudo rm -rf /opt/podlock
----
